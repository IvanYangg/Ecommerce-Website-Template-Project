This project was created in an effort to learn and work with Reactjs in a more hands-on manner. It's a dynamic app with reusable components that pulls data that I added from google's firestore database and features a fully functioning shopping cart, and full login authentication powered by firebase. 

I do not own any of the images used in this project.
